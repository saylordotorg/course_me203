**Unit 1: Ways That Materials Can Fail – What Can Go Wrong?** <span
id="1"></span> 
*When a material is subjected to forces, it responds by changing its
shape. In the worst case, it breaks apart. Engineers identify two types
of shape change: elastic deformation (recoverable) and plastic
deformation (permanent).* Elastic deformation *is when we stretch a
rubber band and it snaps back to its original length when we let go.*
Plastic deformation *is the dent in an automobile fender.*  
  
 *When applied forces are small, we observe only elastic deformation.
For *brittle materials*, that is all we observe. The definition of a
brittle material might be: (elastic deformation) → (fracture).*  
  
 *Other materials are* ductile materials*. For these materials,
increasing the applied forces results in plastic deformation being
superimposed onto the initial elastic deformation. With ductile
materials: (elastic deformation) → (plastic deformation) →
(fracture).*  
  
 *Engineers measure shape change by defining a property called*
mechanical strain*. Strain is a dimensionless number most often
expressed as a percent. (Note: Actually, the engineer does not include
the qualifier* mechanical*, but if we type just* strain *into a search
engine, we will get mostly medical results.) To isolate just the
material properties, the engineer expresses forces as* mechanical
stress,*which is force per unit area like with atmospheric pressure.*  
  
 *When a material suddenly snaps, the situation is referred to as* fast
fracture*. This may occur even when initial force loads appear to be
within safe limits. Contributing conditions can be studied by* impact
testing *(particularly at low temperatures),* fatigue testing *(often
simulating vibration), and* creep testing *(particularly at high
temperatures). Also, considered material failure is interaction with the
environment­* – *corrosion by* oxidation *and/or* wet corrosion*.*

**1.1 Elastic Deformation** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Please note the following information on elastic deformation:*

-   *Materials of high elastic modulus are referred to as stiff;
    materials of low elastic modulus are referred to as flexible.*
-   *The elastic modulus of metals is relatively insensitive to alloy
    content.*
-   *Elastic deformation depends on material property (elastic modulus)
    and geometry (how thick, for example). Generally, materials are not
    chosen based on modulus, because deformation can be restrained by
    changing geometry. We shall see example calculations of this in Unit
    3.*

**1.2 Plastic Yielding** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Please note the following information on plastic yielding:*

-   *Materials of high yield strength are referred to as strong;
    materials of low yield strength are referred to as weak.*
-   *Materials of high percent elongation are referred to as ductile;
    materials of low percent elongation are referred to as brittle.*
-   *Yield strength is sensitive to processing; many metals can be
    processed to be weak during fabrication and subsequently be
    processed to be strong.*
-   *Hardness numbers can be calibrated to be a measure of yield
    strength.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this brief
    video, which presents some of the same information.  
      
     The reference to dislocation motion at the yield stress is a topic
    we will visit later. The hand-sketched stress-strain curve shows
    nicely that plastic deformation occursin addition to elastic
    deformation. Wherever we unload, whether at the yield point or at
    fracture, we recover the elastic deformation, with the sample
    following a line parallel to the initial loading line. Note that the
    curve is not representative of what is seen in the laboratory. For a
    sample of 20% elongation and an elastic limit of about 0.2%, the
    totally elastic region would represent only 1/100<sup>th</sup> of
    the graph – just about the width of the vertical axis line.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this brief
    video to see a tensile sample necking before fracture.  
      
     At the start of the video, the speaker mentions having a
    500-diameter tensile specimen. He means that the sample has a
    diameter of 0.500 inches. Actually, the standard diameter is 0.505
    inches, as this diameter computes a cross-sectional area of 0.200
    square inches, and makes the engineering stress in psi (pounds per
    square inch) numerically five times the force in pounds. If you can
    resolve the graph being plotted by the test machine, you will note
    that this sample exhibits a sharp change in slope (yield point) as
    plastic deformation begins.  
      
     Watching this video (several times as needed) and pausing to take

**1.3 Fast Fracture** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*Please note the following information on fast fracture:*

-   *A critical combination of stress and crack length can result in
    cracks becoming unstable, propagating with the speed of sound to
    snap the product to failure. This occurs even though the nominal
    level of stress is less than the yield stress.*
-   *Micro cracks may be a product of processing, especially in large
    welded structures.*
-   *Micro cracks may also nucleate during service, especially during
    repetitive loading situations or over extended periods of time.*
-   *Materials resistant to fast fracture are referred to as tough.*
-   *Fast fracture is particularly a concern at low temperatures.
    Materials that are ductile at room temperature may become brittle at
    cold temperatures.*

**1.3.1 Energy Criterion** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*A sample with an interior crack has a higher internal energy than a
sample without a crack, because of the surface energy of the crack
surfaces. If this were the only concern, then cracks should be
self-healing to lower the total internal energy. In practice, cracks in
unstressed materials do not heal, but remain at a stable length.
However, if a crack grows into material that is elastically stressed,
the crack lowers the stored elastic energy in the surrounding material.
This favors crack growth. Thus, we have a competition of two effects.
The result of this competition can have two alternative
interpretations:*  

-   *At a given stress (stored elastic energy level), there is a
    critical crack length. Shorter cracks are stable; longer cracks
    propagate to fracture.*
-   *For a given crack length, there is a critical stress. At lower
    stresses, the crack is stable; at higher stresses, the crack
    propagates to fracture.*

**1.4 Fatigue Failure** <span id="1.4"></span> 
*Please note the following information on fatigue failure:*

-   *Fatigue failure is fast fracture occurring after many cycles of
    repetitive stress, often resulting from vibrations during service,
    such as with an airplane wing.*
-   *Tensile stresses nucleate, grow, and eventually cause fast fracture
    of micro cracks.*
-   *Fatigue failure measurements show considerable scatter.*

**1.4.2 Rotating Beam Fatigue Test and S-N Charts** <span
id="1.4.2"></span> 
*A standard documentation of high cycle fatigue failure is the* rotating
beam fatigue test*. A rotating sample is loaded with a torque that
causes a surface element to undergo alternating tension and compression
as the sample rotates. If a crack has nucleated, the tension portion of
the loading causes the crack to grow. The results of many such tests to
failure are summarized on a S-N diagram (Stress versus Cycles to
Failure). This is a statistical summary. Each test defines a single
point. There is typically considerable scatter in the results.*

**1.5 Creep Deformation** <span id="1.5"></span> 
*Please note the following information on creep deformation:*

-   *Creep is plastic deformation that continues to occur over time.*
-   *Creep deformation is very slow. Strain rates of 1% in 1000 hours,
    or even 1% over 10 years, are typical.*
-   *For most materials, creep does not happen at room temperature, only
    at elevated temperatures.*
-   *What constitutes an *elevated *temperature is determined by a
    material’s melting or softening temperature.*

**1.6 Corrosion** <span id="1.6"></span> 
*Please note the following information on corrosion:*

-   *Corrosion is primarily a concern with metals. Plastics and ceramics
    are essentially inert in our common atmosphere.*
-   *Virtually all metals oxidize. However, some oxides are protective,
    while others are not. Our concern, then, is the nature of the oxide
    layer that forms.*
-   *Wet corrosion, also known as electrochemical attack, requires two
    dissimilar materials. These may be two different chemistries, but
    many other common situations can establish differences.*
