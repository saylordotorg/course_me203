**Unit 2: Classes of Engineering Materials – *What Do We Have?*** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The scientist distinguishes materials by the types of bonding between
the atomic particles. This in turn is a study of what the* valence
electrons *of the atoms are doing.*  
  
 *With* metallic bonding, *the valence electrons disassociate from their
parent atoms. They form a cloud that permeates the sample, leaving
behind roughly spherical positive ion cores. This electron cloud
contributes to both the high electrical and the high thermal
conductivity of metals. The spherical ions pack densely into
symmetrical* crystal lattices*. Close-packed planes of ions can slide
(shear) over each other for ductile, plastic deformation. The details of
this sliding involve defects known as* dislocations*.*  
  
 *The defining link in polymers is the* covalent bond*, also known
simply as the* chemical bond*. This is the bond that defines molecules
such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. Covalent bonds require
specific angles, resulting in lower density materials. Often, rotation
can occur around a covalent bond, leading to rubber-like elasticity.
Some polymers, called* thermoplastic *plastics, consist of long chains,
somewhat analogous to a bowl of cooked spaghetti. Other plastics,
called* thermosetting *plastics, are a 3D network of strong covalent
bonds.*  
  
 *Many ceramic materials are again made up of roughly spherical ions,
but of differing sizes. Here, a valence electron has escaped from one
type of atom and been captured by a different type of atom, resulting
in* ionic bonding*. The smaller positive ions and larger negative ions
again pack into symmetrical crystal lattices. Any shearing of planes
would bring similar charges into proximity, a condition of strong
repulsive force, but this doesn’t happen. Ceramics are brittle. Concrete
is considered a ceramic. Other common ceramics include oxides, nitrides,
and carbides, which have covalent bonds.*  
  
 *As the name suggests, composite materials are combinations of the
above. Common engineering composites are* GFRPs *(graphite fiber
reinforced polymers) and* CFRPs *(carbon fiber reinforced polymers).*
Cermets *are combinations of ceramics and metals. A naturally occurring
composite material is wood.*

    engineering material: metals, plastics (also know as polymers), and
    ceramics;

**2.1 Metals** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Most metals are strong, easy to shape, and relatively inexpensive.*
-   *Metals can be alloyed to be serviceable at extremes of low and high
    temperatures.*
-   *Many metals can be alloyed to be heat treatable – ductile in one
    state and strong in another.*
-   *Many metals are excellent conductors of both heat and electricity.*

*Limitations*
-   *Metals are relatively heavy.*
-   *Many metals chemically react with gases and liquids.*

*Each class of material has many, often hundreds, of entries. From the
metals, we will select four to follow through our comparisons in Unit 3.
Two are familiar – steels and aluminum alloys. Two are a little more
exotic – magnesium alloys and titanium alloys. We will also look at some
other metals in a less comprehensive way.*

**2.2 Polymers** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Polymers are light in weight.*
-   *Most polymers are chemically inert.*
-   *Polymers can be colored throughout, not just surface coated.*
-   *Elastomers and foamed polymers have unique properties.*

*Limitations*
-   *Most polymers are essentially room-temperature materials, breaking
    down at either low or high temperatures.*
-   *Many polymers are soft and scratch easily.*

*From the class of polymers, we will select six engineering plastics to
follow through our comparisons in Unit 3. Each has a wide variety of
applications. We will identify a few uses to establish familiarity.*

**2.2.2 Elastomers** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Elastomer is the scientific name for the familiar rubber-like polymers.
These include natural rubber, silicone rubber, and hard and soft butyl
rubbers. Whereas the elastic limit of metals and ceramics is about 0.1%
strain, rubbery materials can be elastically deformed several hundred
percent. Elastomers have an available deformation mechanism that the
other materials do not. Like thermoplastics, elastomers are comprised of
long molecular chains. In elastomers, these chains tend to be curled up
like a ball of yarn in the unstressed condition. Application of a force
tends to uncurl the molecular chains, but this is an elastic, reversible
deformation.*

**2.2.3 Foamed Polymers** <span id="2.2.3"></span> 
*Foamed polymers, like Styrofoam<sup>®</sup> coffee cups and
polyurethane building insulation, consist mainly of closed cells of
trapped air. This makes them lightweight and mechanically weak, but also
gives them unique properties. It is the trapped dead air spaces that
provide thermal insulation, not the polymers themselves. Foamed polymers
are useful as packing materials, as they can absorb energy by the
crushing of cells, rather than by deformation of a solid material.*

**2.3 Ceramics** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Ceramics are very hard, good for saw blades and drill bits.*
-   *Ceramics are stable to very high temperatures.*
-   *Ceramics are inert to corrosion.*

*Limitations*  
-   *Ceramics are brittle.*
-   *Ceramics can require special processing to form.*

**2.3.2 Porous Ceramics** <span id="2.3.2"></span> 
*These materials are loosely defined and frequently contain several
chemical constituents. They become solid ceramics by firing (as with
brick, pottery, porcelain) or by chemical reaction, often involving
water (as with mortar and concrete).*

**2.4 Composite Materials** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Composites can utilize the best of different materials groups.*
-   *The internal structure of composites may sometimes be controlled in
    unique ways – to obtain highly directional properties, for example.*

*Limitations*
-   *Special processing can lead to expensive products.*
-   *Compatibility of using different materials can cause special
    problems. Will they successfully bond together, for example?*

**2.4.1 Advantages of Composite Materials** <span id="2.4.1"></span> 
*A composite seeks to take advantage of the strengths of two different
materials by bonding them together. A familiar example is reinforced
concrete. A steel rod is strong in tension, but will buckle under
compression. Concrete, like most brittle materials, is about ten times
stronger in compression than in tension. By embedding steel reinforcing
bars (rebar) within the concrete, we obtain a product that has better
combined tensile and compressive strengths than either material
alone.*  
  
 *Another familiar composite is steel-belted automobile tires. We obtain
the desired friction with the rubber, together with the stiffening of
steel for increased fuel efficiency.*

**2.4.2 Engineering Composites** <span id="2.4.2"></span> 
*We will look at three types of engineering composites in our
comparisons in Unit 3: glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP), more
commonly known as fiberglass; carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP),
found in sports products; and ceramic/metal combinations. The polymers
are generally epoxy resins, making GFRP and CFRP lighter than most
metals.*  
  
 *In addition to combining physical properties, fiber composites can be
layered with fibers in alternative layers and orientated in different
directions to give desired spatial distribution of strength.*

**2.4.3 Wood: Nature’s Composite Material** <span id="2.4.3"></span> 
*Similar to aligned polymer molecules, common woods such as pine, oak,
maple, and others have a grain structure. Properties measured parallel
to the grain are generally different from properties measured
perpendicular to the grain.*
