**Unit 4: Processing of Materials – *How Can We Shape It?*** <span
id="4"></span> 
*A material may have the properties we wish, but we still have to shape
it for it to be useful as a part. We will consider* casting, mechanical
forming, sintering, welding, *and* brazing*. These processing techniques
will be generally familiar, but we will take a closer look at advantages
and disadvantages, and at some specific considerations.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 18 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.4: 5 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   identify the principal concerns of common materials processing
    techniques; and
-   examine advantages and disadvantages of alternative processing
    techniques when selecting materials.

**4.1 Casting** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Complex shapes can be formed in a single step.*
-   *Chemically reacting components, such as thermosetting resins and
    concrete, can be cast.*

*Limitations*
-   *Preparing molds may be time-consuming and expensive.*
-   *Not all materials can be cast. Some deteriorate at elevated
    temperatures before they melt.*
-   *The solidification process imparts a grain structure to the
    interior of the casting that may not be desirable.*

    hardening by solidification and chemical reaction.

     Instructions: Watch this demonstration of an artist’s use of

    speculated technique of Dutch sculptor Adriaen de Vries (*ca.*
    1556–1626).

**4.2 Mechanical Forming** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Cold forming strengthens as well as shapes metals.*
-   *Long shapes, such as rods and tubes, can be made by extrusion.*
-   *Hot forming allows almost unlimited change in shape without change
    in properties.*

*Limitations*  
-   *Cold forming increases the brittleness of a metal.*
-   *Like casting, cold forming imparts internal structure to metals.*
-   *Brittle materials cannot be mechanically shaped without fracture.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and watch this brief
    video. This is a presentation of how a plane can be shifted by
    dislocation movement. The dislocation is into the plane of the
    drawing, so that we are looking at the end of a line. A different
    definition of dislocation density is mentioned than that given in
    the next section. The two definitions are equivalent.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this video,
    which illustrates the annealing of copper. We have to take the
    narrator’s word that the copper strip is either stiff or soft, but
    this video emphasizes the purpose of annealing.  
      
     *Note: The narrator’s description of work hardening is incorrect.
    There are no molecules of copper coming closer together; rather,
    work hardening is caused by the increased density and subsequent
    entanglement of dislocations discussed in the previous section.*

**4.3 Sintering** <span id="4.3"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *High-melting and brittle materials often can be formed no other
    way.*
-   *Special properties may be achieved by impregnating the porous
    sintered product with oil, for example.*

*Limitations*
-   *Specialized equipment involving high temperature and atmosphere
    control are often necessary.*
-   *The variable density and variation in other mechanical properties
    of sintered materials may be of concern.*

**4.4 Joining** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*Advantages*

-   *Welding and brazing are often economical alternatives to machining
    or casting.*
-   *In the field, repair by welding or brazing can often prevent
    replacement of original parts.*

*Limitations*
-   *Welding is a sequence of alloying, casting, and heat treatment.
    This complex event has many possibilities for less than desired
    results.*
-   *Not all materials can be joined by melting them together.*
