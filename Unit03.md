**Unit 3: Comparison of Engineering Materials – *Which Is Best?*** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit draws from the previous two units. How do we select a
material to produce a particular part? We need to avoid the possible
failures described in Unit 1 by selecting the best material from the
classes listed in Unit 2. Most often, there will be several competing
candidates. Part of the evaluation will also include consideration of
how the materials can be shaped, which we will investigate in Unit 4.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and view this brief
    video. The video presents an application of using handbook data and
    calculations to select a material for strength and stiffness. While
    identified as elastic design, yield stress is needed to establish an
    upper limit for elastic deformation.  
      
     Note: At one point the narrator misrepresents the units of a
    calculation. When calculating the applied stress, the narrator
    speaks the units as though they were written N•m and then writes
    them N/m. Neither is correct. The units for stress are
    N/m<sup>2</sup> or Pa (newtons per meters squared or pascals).  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

**3.6 Fatigue Failure Resistance** <span id="3.6"></span> 
**3.6.1 Geometry** <span id="3.6.1"></span> 
*Geometry is very important when fatigue loading is a concern. While the
overall nominal stress in a part subject to fatigue loading may be kept
within calculated safe limits, the local stress at geometric transitions
can be much higher. This promotes the nucleation of cracks at these
locations, such as at sharp corners. For simple geometries, charts,
tables, and equations are available to give values of* stress
concentration factors*. These are multiplying factors between nominal
and higher actual stresses. When geometries and loadings are
complicated, computer modeling is used. The conclusion is that we should
minimize sharp angles with rounded corners to forestall nucleation of
fatigue cracks.*

**3.6.2 Surface Treatments** <span id="3.6.2"></span> 
*Fatigue failure is sensitive to surface finish. A smooth, polished
surface is more resistant than a rough surface. Surface scratches and
irregularities can be nucleation sites for fatigue cracks. Further,
since cracks grow during the tension portion of fatigue, any treatment
that imparts residual compressive stresses into the surface will
lengthen fatigue life. A fairly simple procedure to treat metals is*
shot peening*. Parts are tumbled in a bath of hardened metal, ceramic,
or glass spheres with sufficient force to cause compressive plastic
deformation of the surface.*
